--- abstract

This document provides an approach how to reason about the composition of multi-path aware transport stacks. It discusses how to compose the functionality needed by stacking existing internet protocols and the fundamental mechanisms that are used in multi-path systems and the consequences of applying them to different granularities of communication units, e.g, on a message or stream granularity.
This document is targeted as guidance for automation of destination selection, path selection, and transport protocol selection.

# Introduction         {#intro}

Today's Internet architecture faces a communication endpoint with a
set of choices, including choosing a transport protocol and picking an
IP protocol version.
In many cases, e.g., when fetching data from a CDN, an endpoint
has also the choice of which endpoint instance,
{{I-D.brunstrom-taps-impl}} calls these instances ``Derived
Endpoint``, to contact as DNS can return multiple alternative addresses.

If endpoints want to take advantage of multiple available paths,
there is another bunch of, partially interdependent, choices:

- Which path(s) between the endpoints could be used?
- Which path(s) between the endpoints should be used?
- Should the paths be used in an active/active way or only as active/fallback?
- Which protocols or sets of protocols should be used?
- Which role will other on-path elements, e.g. middle-boxes, take
  in servicing this flow?

Implementing an heuristic or strategy for choosing from this
overwhelming set of transport options by each application puts a huge
burden on the application developer.
Thus, the decisions regarding all transport options mentioned so far
should be supported and, if requested by the application, automated
within a the transport layer.
In order to build such automatization, we need to be able to compare
the product of all transport options (destinations, paths, transport
protocols and protocol options) available to choose the most
appropriate.

As the protocols to be used are not known a priori and can differ
depending on other transport options, this reasoning has to be
independent of a specific protocol or implementation and allow to
compare them even if they operate on different communication unit
granularities.


## Communication Units vs. Layering

When reasoning about network systems, layering traditionally has been the main guidance on where functionality is placed.
Looking at modern systems, the classical concept of layers and their mapping to protocols becomes blurry.
Protocols can operate on different granularities of communication units, i.e., the semantic units such as messages that the protocols distinguish.
These communication units often do not match the PDUs used by the protocols, e.g., TCP segments do not necessarily align with messages at the application layer.

In this document, we do not want to take a protocol-centric perspective, but we focus on mechanisms a multi-access system is composed of and the communication units they operate on.
This has several advantages:

- We can much easier abstract from the protocols used and look
  at the composition itself.

- By disseminate on which kind of communication unit these mechanisms can operate, we can reason about the overall design space.

- If seeing the same mechanism multiple times within the same
  system composition, we can reason about possibly conflicting
  optimizations.

Overall, this perspective allows us to compare mechanism like
distributing requests of an application among different paths, MPTCP
and using bandwidth aggregation proxies (as discussed within the IETF
in the BANANA working group) despite their different nature and layer
of implementation.



# Abstract Hierarchy of Communication Units {#unit-h}

These communication units definitions are primarily used for reasoning
about automatic stack composition. Therefore, depending on the protocol
stack instance, a communication unit can span multiple protocol
instances.

Some of these hierarchy levels correspond to objects in
{{I-D.ietf-taps-minset}}, but in case of Association and Association
Set, we have to split categories as they may indeed be separate on the
transport.
Note the naming confusion concerning the term "flow" deriving from different perspective.

We also annotate the corresponding terminology used in {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}} if it differs from the one used in this document.

## Message

An Message is a piece of data that has a meaning for the application.
It is the smallest communication unit that we consider.

{{I-D.ietf-taps-minset}} correspondent: Message

Examples:

- A HTTP-Request/Response-Header/Body for HTTP/2
- An XML message in XMPP


## Stream

A Stream is an ordered sequence of related Messages that should be treated the same by the transport system.

{{I-D.ietf-taps-minset}} correspondent: Flow

Examples:

- A Stream in QUIC or SCTP
- A TCP connection used as transport for XMPP


## Association / Connection Group

An Association multiplexes a set of Messages or Streams within the same Flow
with common source and destination. Therefore these communication units become
indistinguishable for the network.
Association and flow describe the same concept, the former from the perspective
of the application, the latter from the perspective of the network.

{{I-D.ietf-taps-minset}} correspondent: Flow-Group

{{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}} correspondent: Connection Group
Examples:

- A TCP connection carrying HTTP/2 frames
- A set of IP packets that carry TCP or UDP segments and share the same 5-tuple of src-address, dst-address, protocol, src-port, dest-port.


## Association Set / Flow-Group

An Association Set or Flow Set is a set of Associations or Flows that belong
together from an application point of view.

{{I-D.ietf-taps-minset}} correspondent: Flow-Group

Examples:

- Two flows, one carrying RTP payloads and one used for RTCP control messages.



# Mechanisms Used in Multi-Path Systems

Transport protocols on the Internet provide a large variety of functionality.
While the functionality of simple protocols like UDP is easy to describe (multiplexing streams of messages), describing the functionality of complex protocols such as QUIC, MPTCP or SCTP is manyfold as these protocols provide a set of commonly used functionality.
Also, the same functionality can be provided at many places throughout the whole stack.
In the following, we explore the set of functionality that can be provided by transport protocols.


## Destination Selection

Destination Selection refers to selecting one of multiple
different destinations. This mechanism is applicable to any kind
of communication unit and can occur on all layers.

Typical cases for destination selection include:

- Choosing one address of a multi-homed server for an upcoming communication.
- Choosing a server among a list of servers retuned by DNS,
   e.g for servers that host the same content as part of a CDN.
- Choosing a backend server within a load balancer.

In practice, destination address selection is often tied to name
resolution.
As name resolution relies on both local decisions on the endpoint as well
as decisions within the DNS infrastructure, this mechanism spreads
across different administrative domains which each independently
contribute to the overall selection result.


## Path Selection

Path Selection refers to choosing which of the available paths to use.
and can occur on the network layer and any layer below.

- Within an end-host, path selection is usually realized by choosing
  the source IP address and thus choosing one of the local network
  interfaces for the communication to the remote endpoint.
- Within a path layer traffic system like an MPTCP-Proxy or
  a BANANA-Box, path selection is usually realized by choosing the
  outer source and destination address.
- In case of an ECMP router, path selection is usually done based on
  a 3- or 5-tupel and just determines the interface to the next hop.
- Within MPTCP, each TCP segment has to be assigned to one or more
  subflows for transmission to the receiver.

While path selection involves a choice of access network it does not
need knowledge of or changes to the routing choices within the core
network.

When doing path selection on small communication units like TCP
segments, it is not uncommon to split path selection into two
subproblems: *Candidate Path Selection* determines feasible and
preferred choices, e.g., in case of MPTCP by establishing subflows.
Afterwards, *Per-Chunk Path Selection* selects among these alternatives
for each chunk. Thus, the first can be more expensive while the latter
should be easy to execute.

TODO: Discuss difference between Multiple Provisioning Domains
{{RFC7556}} or multiple access networks within the same provisioning
domain â€“ especially when it comes to integrating 3GPP mechanisms like
{{RFC5555}} or {{RFC7864}}.


## Chunking

Chunking refers to splitting an message, a stream or a set of associations into one or more parts.
Typically, chunking splits only large messages or streams into multiple
ones while keeping smaller entities untouched.
Associations or Flows are typically not split, but sets
of Associations or Flows might be partitioned.
Once split into chunks, each chunk can be transferred individually over
different transfer options.

Chunking can and does occur at different layers within a system:

- A Web site consists of multiple objects or files.
  Thus, the files can be seen as the natural chunks of a Web site.
- TCP takes as input a byte stream and chunks it into segments.
  TCP chunking (segmentation) occurs at arbitrary byte ranges,
  thus it will most likely not align with boundaries of Messages that
  were multiplexed within an application layer Association on top of
  a TCP connection.

In practice, chunking is often constrained in order to maintain certain
properties that are desirable for the overall system.
Examples such restrictions include the following:

- Segmentation in TCP restrict the chunk size,
  i.e. TCP segment size, to the IP MTU  or IP Path MTU to avoid
  fragmentation at the IP layer.

- Equal cost multipath routing does not distribute packets, but
  Flows to avoid reordering.


## Scheduling

Scheduling refers to distributing chunks or sets of chunks across
multiple pre-chosen path. Thus, depending on the objectives, it can
make sense to see scheduling as is nothing else than per-chunk path
selection as defined above. In other cases, e.g. when trying to balance
traffic, it makes sense to look at scheduling as a concept itself that
uses chunking and per-chunk path selection as sub-mechanisms.

Examples of scheduling strategies include:

- Schedule all chunks on one path as long as this path is available, otherwise fall pack to another.
- Distribute chunks based on path capacity.



# Cost of Transport Option Selection


Transport option selection mechanisms are often intertwined.
 Which mechanism is used by which layer or which network component
depends on the transfer objectives as well as the state of the network,
e.g., availability, path throughput, path RTT, server load.

The cost and complexity of transport option selection depends on the
network state used and the number of transfer options.
If the transfer option selection only uses local state e.g., link
availability, and the mechanism is predetermined and/or uses simple
mechanisms, e.g., a simple hash function, the cost can even be
negligible.
An example where transfer option selection is cheap is ECMP
within a router.
In other cases, the cost can be non-trivial, e.g. when the selection
involves queries to remote entities or even active network performance
measurements.
Such examples include DNS or DHT lookups, as used by some file sharing
protocols, or network measurements like RTT and bandwidth estimations
used by many video streaming applications. Indeed, costs may be
prohibitive, e.g when requiring multiple DNS lookups for every 1 second
chunk of a 20 minute video.



# Involvement of On-Path Elements


It may become necessary to take path layer components (middle-boxes)
into account that interfere with the transport layer.

While the classical "End-To-End Arguments in System Design"
{{End-To-End}} advocates for a dumb network and placing functionality
as close to the edge and up in the stack as possible, there are always
tussles of moving functionality up or down the stack.
This document does not argue against pushing some multi-path
functionality down the stack, but advocates to maintain the control
of the overall system composition at the end host.
Functionality provided by a path can indeed be a reason to choose this path for a given communication unit.

Some flow off-loading mechanisms that come in gestalt of of logical interfaces, e.g., {{RFC7847}}.
These interfaces treat some association sets differently, which can be considered on-path functionality.
